# FUT-AutoTrader
NOTE: Has not been updated to include support for FIFA 19 and likely needs another update to include support for FIFA 18's latest update. Updating the application to include support for FIFA 19 would be trivial but I do not own the game, and beacuse of this, would not be able to test the application.

Automatic Fifa Ultimate Team trading bot based on fut python package. This Program allows individuals to specify players and a target price and the program will then troll the fifa market and attempt to bid on players who match these requirments. The program has multiple bidding modes and will switch between them in order to attempt to maximze its effictiveness. Additionally, the bot keeps track of the amount of requests that it makes (and the speed that it makes them in) in order to avoid detection by EA. This allows the user to use the program for hours on end and not have their account get banned.
